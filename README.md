🎶 RemasterShadhi: AI Multi-Language Lyric Generator
​RemasterShadhi is a modern, single-file HTML web application that leverages the Gemini API to generate structured, multi-language song lyrics based on a user-provided theme, story, or emotion. It supports multiple languages, including English, Hindi, Tamil, and Malayalam.

​Advanced Controls: Fine-tune the output using optional parameters like Genre, Mood/Tone, Target Audience, Rhyme Scheme, and Artist Style.
​Modern Design: Fully responsive, dark-themed UI built exclusively with Tailwind CSS.
​Robust API Handling: Implements exponential backoff and a retry mechanism for reliable lyric generation.
